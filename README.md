This is an automated script to install all REON-Project Mobile Adapter GB Server Services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[IMPORTANT INFO] Please make sure /var/www/web/ and /var/www/config.json do not exist before starting installation. Script does not check for that.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please use ./runall.sh to install everything automatically.

This calls the other scripts automatically and installs everything for you.
If you dont want to let the scripts install any packages, run the scripts and anything you need
by running the scripts manually. 
But you will need to input the variables either in the code or by deleting the
scipts you dont need from ./runall.sh
